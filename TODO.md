# Discussion items:
- where is this GPU notebook from lecture 3? I wasn't able to find it on the site or in the Github repo.
- Discuss idea of a "reflected Kernel" (see `convolve` fn in HW2). Why reflected?
  - also, discuss why the function name is `filter`.. the function commit actually has a nice explainer under "Details"!
  - @n to learn more about fourier transforms.. will this class cover or can we find/make a Pluto notebook to learn more?
- My environment seems to be quite slow when running `shrink_n(img, 200, seam_algo)`... previously I thought it was the earlier Seam Carving implementations slowing it down, but now I'm wondering if something else might be going on, as even the `seam_from_precomputed_least_energy` "efficient" implementation is failing .. perhaps I have a bug in my efficient implementation :D
  - OK so people on the Discord are saying that there IS at least one issue in `shrink_n`, in that it recomputes the energies every time. https://discord.com/channels/750379744478101544/753830251146117141/764261843782336563
  - possible way to improve: https://discord.com/channels/750379744478101544/753830251146117141/760606966388621322

- How much more efficient is the storage of the SVD version of the image vs the source image (216x384)?

# TODO

- [ ] HW2: Rewrite a shrink_n that doesn't recompute least_energy matrix (the expensive part!) on each iteration.
- [ ] use broadcast `.` more. E.g. `noisify.(image, s)` to broadcast a function.
- [ ] try writing docstrings for my own functions and see if they appear in Pluto
- [x] is it possible to write assertions or tests within a Pluto notebook?
  - Yes! In HW2, they use an `@assert` within a function.
  ```julia
  function remove_in_each_row_views(img, column_numbers)
	  @assert size(img, 1) == length(column_numbers) # same as the number of rows
    ...
  end
  ```
- [ ] Learn keyboard shortcuts for Pluto (https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl/issues/65#issue-595782206)
- [ ] Setup a `juliarc.jl` file with convenience functions and prefs
  - [ ] e.g. can support more math chars via https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36358017/subscript-multiple-characters-in-julia-variable-name
- [ ] L5: review eigenvalues: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors
- [ ] L5: review SVD: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition
- [ ] Explore writing Julia within VSCode. How is that vs Pluto?
  - How is the feedback loop for viewing plots and playing with images? (https://www.julia-vscode.org/)
  - Is there a Pluto binding so I can edit code in VSCode but otherwise render in Pluto? (https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl/issues/303)
