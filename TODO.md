# Discussion items:
- Lecture 7
  - Whoa! A date window is a blurring aka convolution!
  - gotcha in lecture: `head` (deprecated, even tho common outside Julia) vs `first`
  - When to use symbol `:country` or string `"country"`?
  - `DataFrameRow` vs "`DataFrame` with one row", reminds me of the confusion around extracting a column vector when pulling a single row of a multidimensional array. The same syntax works there to get a row, if desired!
    - `a = rand(2,2)` .. then compare`a[1, :]` which gets a Vector vs `a[1:1, :]` which gets a 1x2 Array (is this effectively the same thing as a row vector, or is that another type?)
    ```julia
    julia> a = rand(2,2)
    2×2 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.180562  0.673759
    0.130636  0.22324

    julia> a[1, :]
    2-element Array{Float64,1}:
    0.18056244592673543
    0.6737588383904296

    julia> a[1:1, :]
    1×2 Array{Float64,2}:
    0.180562  0.673759
    ```
- Is there a magical way to discover methods from a package more easily? e.g. how can I know all the useful functions I might apply to a dataframe? autocompletion to discover functionality (or simply remember a method name) seemsharder in Julia
- Discuss idea of a "reflected Kernel" (see `convolve` fn in HW2). Why reflected?
  - also, discuss why the function name is `filter`.. the function commit actually has a nice explainer under "Details"!
  - @n to learn more about fourier transforms.. will this class cover or can we find/make a Pluto notebook to learn more?
- How much more efficient is the storage of the SVD version of the image vs the source image (216x384)?

# TODO


- [ ] PRs to ComputationalThinking Github
  - clarify `least_energy` vs `energies` in HW.
  - add Lecture 7.2, 7.3: add a `head` function or use `first(df, 10)`
- [ ] HW2: Rewrite a shrink_n that doesn't recompute least_energy matrix (the expensive part!) on each iteration.
- [ ] use broadcast `.` more. E.g. `noisify.(image, s)` to broadcast a function.
- [ ] try writing docstrings for my own functions and see if they appear in Pluto
- [x] is it possible to write assertions or tests within a Pluto notebook?
  - Yes! In HW2, they use an `@assert` within a function.
  ```julia
  function remove_in_each_row_views(img, column_numbers)
	  @assert size(img, 1) == length(column_numbers) # same as the number of rows
    ...
  end
  ```
- [ ] Learn keyboard shortcuts for Pluto (https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl/issues/65#issue-595782206)
- [ ] Setup a `juliarc.jl` file with convenience functions and prefs
  - [ ] e.g. can support more math chars via https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36358017/subscript-multiple-characters-in-julia-variable-name
  - a starter: `head(x) = first(x, 10)`
- [ ] L5: review eigenvalues: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors
- [ ] L5: review SVD: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition
- [ ] Explore writing Julia within VSCode. How is that vs Pluto?
  - How is the feedback loop for viewing plots and playing with images? (https://www.julia-vscode.org/)
  - Is there a Pluto binding so I can edit code in VSCode but otherwise render in Pluto? (https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl/issues/303)
