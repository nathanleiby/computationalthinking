Talk about the underpinnings of algos, notably: graphs.

> I don't mean to start too basic, but I feel like maybe you can never start to basic with this kind of stuff

Start with a graph of a binary tree.

_Parent_ node has _child_ nodes.

1. How do we write this in code?
2. How do we move (traverse) this graph?

In Julia shell, he includes the file he created

`include("tree.jl")`

:( having challenges live

Traversing a tree is more complex: DFS? BFS?

Lots of technical challenges :( Sorry, James!

~25m seems like where more insights kick in.
