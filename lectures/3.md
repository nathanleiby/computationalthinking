How to understand partial derivative ith respect to `x`? i.e. moving left to right.

```
A B C
D E F
G H I
```

Some ideas:
- `(F - E)`
- `(F - D)`

Sobel is something like `(C - A) + 2 (F - D) + (I - G)`
which gives more weight to the middle row.

"partial derivative in a direction"
aka
"gradient vector"
aka
"descent/ascent"
