# Lecture 18 - Hierarchical Thinking

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJyJZ_fMy9Q&feature=youtu.be

examples:
- zooming into a map and seeing different levels
- employees in a company (manager relationships, departments)
- "grids": _coarse_ vs _fine_
  - compared
    - quick approximate answer vs resolve finer details
    - understand big phenomena vs detailed phenomena
    - less computation/complexity vs more
  - sometimes can use coarse answer to refine where you want to explore finely

Can apply this thinking to MANY problems. How can we start coarse and then go fine later?
