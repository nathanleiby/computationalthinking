# Lecture 5 - Programming environments for Julia

Why is programming difficult?

- Writing code: How do for loops work, why does println work, what is multiple dispatch?
- Running code on your own machine

Often, the logic is easier than actually "running" it!

Being able to run code in the terminal and being able to write code in his own text editor helped him gain intuition into what was happening.

1. text editors
   - examples: Vim, Nano, notepad++
   - simple setup
   - sometimes a challenge to learn the editor!
2. IDEs
   - examples: VSCode, Atom (for Julia, these are IDE-like)
   - Often, feature rich
   - they combine editing and running into one environment
4. Notebooks
   - examples: Pluto, Jupyter, etc
   - great for classes

=> Decide on the environment that works best for you!
