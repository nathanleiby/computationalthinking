# Lecture 11 - Everybody talks about R0

Differential equation models exist for the models like:
- SIR
- SEIR

Alan suggests making a toy model of your own to think through the problem.

```
Patient 1
Day 0 - patient 1 gets exposed
Day 1 - patient 1 in infects another person
Day 2 - patient 1 in infects another person
(end)
```

In this model, `R_0 = 2` because patient infects 1 other person.

His model grows like Fibonnaci sequence.

btw Fibonacci is related to "golden ratio".. population, growth, and more can be written in terms of `phi`
